# MongoDB $inc Operator Error with String Value
This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in MongoDB when using the `$inc` operator with a non-numeric value. The error arises from attempting to increment a field using a string instead of a number, which leads to an invalid operation. 

The `bug.js` file contains the incorrect implementation, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.
